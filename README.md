# Python-projects
_Hey there._

These are some of the projects I made in python.

1. **Hangman**                     
The popular word game.              
Here the number of lives you get is the number of missing characters in the given word.

2. **Sudoko**             
In this I used backtracking to find the solution of a valid game.                    
The next space is filled with any valid number and when the cursor encounters a situtaion where the the number inserted is violating the rules it backtracks and tries other valid number and so on till it completes the whole puzzle.

_.......I will add more later as I go. 
Thanks_:grinning:
